# Tag2Text: Guiding Vision-Language Model via Image Tagging

Official PyTorch Implementation of the <a href="">Tag2Text</a> paper. We will fully open ource the code and data in the future.

Welcome to try out [Tag2Text Web demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/xinyu1205/Tag2Text)! It is integrated into [Huggingface Spaces ðŸ¤—](https://huggingface.co/spaces) using [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio). 


## Abstract

Tag2Text achieves a superior image tag recognition ability by exploiting fine-grained text information. By leveraging tagging guidance, Tag2Text effectively enhances the performance of vision-language models on both generation-based and alignment-based tasks.
